| **Regulatory Bodies**  | Establishes the Data Protection Board of India and designates the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal.                | Addresses mixed datasets (containing both personal and non-personal data) under personal data protection standards, aligning with practices like the GDPR in Europe. |





# Impact

## Impact of Data Protection Regulations on Platform Gig Economy​



## Gaps in Existing Policy Instruments


::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

Personal Data

- Employers can process data without consent for performance assessment and employment decisions, citing ‘reasonable expectation.’
- Applicability to gig workers, not yet classified as “employees,” remains unclear.
- Consent exceptions include ‘reasonable purposes’ like fraud prevention and performance assessment.

:::

::: {.column}

Non-Personal Data (NPD)

- 2020 reports propose frameworks to maximise NPD use, risking privacy due to potential de-anonymisation.
- Inferred/derived NPD is owned by corporations, limiting workers’ collective rights over its narrative.

# Proposed Solutions {auto-animate=true}

## {auto-animate=true}

- Active consent, not deemed consent, for data collection, processing and exchange should be the express requirement in the context of data fiduciary (here, platforms) – data principal (here, gig workers) relationships.​

- Reduce scope of consent override - A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data. Data Protection Authority proposed by the act should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance.​
- Create market alternatives to the big tech companies - States like Kerala and Karnataka are stepping up with alternatives like the Kerala Savaari app and Namma Yatri app, offering market-driven solutions that prioritise both drivers and consumers. ​

- Platform Work Directive (PWD) – EU directive worth following in India; consists a clause on “presumption of employment”—which means workers shall be legally presumed as employees if their link with their platform meets at least two out of five specific criteria, which include: control over pay and working hours; performance monitoring; task allocation and distribution; control over working conditions; and restrictions on work organisation.​

## What comes first? Social security or Privacy?​


:::{.incremental}
- No protection under labour legislations ​
​
- Ambiguous definition under Code of Social Security, 2020 (yet to be enforced)​
​
- Data protection for employees but what about gig workers? And the regulation of their "aggregators"? ​
​
- Certain protections listed for "employees", but the exploitation of gig workers is "legitimate use"
:::


## Gaps in Existing Policy Instruments​

**Personal Data**

- Contains provisions related to ‘legitimate reason’ to access and process data without consent - allows for the automatic processing of a data principal’s personal data for the purposes of employment, including recruitment, verification of attendance and assessment of performance, among others.

- Data can also be processed without consent for ‘reasonable purposes’ like fraud prevention.


**Non Personal Data**

- Aims to maximise NPD processing and commercialisation, but overrides privacy concerns owing to the possibility of de-anonymisation of data to link it to specific workers.​

- Categorises inferred and derived data to be private NPD, where platform companies would have ownership of the intellectual property - dearth of entitlements regarding workers’ collective rights over controlling the narrative that such inferred data may present about them. ​

| **Penalties for Non-Compliance** | Up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover, whichever is higher.         | Up to ₹250 crore (~€28 million).                                           |
| **Cross-Border Data Transfer** | Permitted with adequate safeguards (e.g., adequacy decisions).                  | Allows transfer only to approved countries ensuring similar protection levels. |
| **Focus on Automation**    | Addresses rights related to automated decision-making and profiling.             | Lacks specific provisions for automated decision-making.                   |




# Gig workers India and the UK {.unlisted}

## India
- **Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), 2023**:
  - Applies to the processing of digital personal data within India.
  - Requires consent for data processing and mandates data fiduciaries to implement security safeguards. [oai_citation_attribution:1‡Meity](https://www.meity.gov.in/content/digital-personal-data-protection-act-2023?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
- **Challenges**:
  - Awareness among gig workers about data rights remains low.
  - Enforcement mechanisms are still developing.

## United Kingdom
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**:
  - Grants individuals rights over their personal data, including access, rectification, and erasure.
  - Applies to all organizations processing personal data of UK residents.
- **Challenges**:
  - Gig platforms have been criticized for obstructing data subject access requests (DSARs).
  - Concerns about invasive surveillance practices persist.



# Algorithmic Control

## India
- **Current Practices**:
  - Platforms use algorithms for task assignments and performance evaluations.
  - Lack of transparency in decision-making processes.
- **Challenges**:
  - Workers have limited recourse to contest algorithmic decisions.
  - Significant control exerted by platforms over worker autonomy.

## United Kingdom
- **Current Practices**:
  - Similar reliance on algorithmic management for task allocation and monitoring.
- **Challenges**:
  - Workers raise concerns about fairness and lack of transparency.
  - Legal actions initiated to demand algorithmic accountability.
